# Meal Tracking Application

This application helps track meal orders and details, built with a ReactJS client and a NodeJS server.

## Project Structure
- **Client Folder**: Contains the code for the ReactJS frontend.
- **Server Folder**: Contains the code for the NodeJS backend.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   At the root level, install all dependencies for both the client and server by running:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
2. **Start the Applications**  
   To start both the client and server simultaneously, run the command in the root directory:
   ```bash
   npm start

This will launch the React frontend and the Node.js backend server, allowing you to access the full functionality of the Meal Tracking Application.
